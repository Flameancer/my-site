                <p> I graduated High School from <a href=""> Victory ChristianCenter</a> in May of 2013 in Charlotte, North Carolina. That same year I achieved my Eagle Scout ranking for the Boy Scouts of America in Troop 23 and enrolled in <a href=""> Carleton College</a>in
                    Northfield, Minnesota to start my college carreer. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <p> During my time at Carleton, academically I learned many different programming languages such as Python, Java, and web languages like HTML and CSS. Outside of academics, I broaden my knowledge on information technology. In the summer of
                    2015 I was an employee of Carleton's IT helpdesk where there I learned how to build and maintain computer labs running Windows 7 and OSX 10 (Mavericks). My work didn't stop there. I also helped the faculty/staff and the student body
                    with their own devices which incldued various versions of Windows, MacOS, iOS, and Android. </p>

                <p> Since then I've done work for <a href="">OnStar</a> Where I've managed user accounts and expanded my IT knowledge into learning Linux and learning Networking in preperation to take the CCNA. As of right now I'm currently an contractor
                    for
                    <a href=""> Charter Specturm</a> (formerly Time Warner cable) as a Security Analyst. My current duties entail malware and spam prevention in where I monitor the network and alert customers of potential infections as well as give removal
                    and prevention tips. From here I plan on branching out to either focusing on Network engineering or become a penetration tester. </p>

            <div class="row">
                <p> Right now my free time involves learning modern network and secruity practices, self-hosting and managing a home server, playing video games, and consulting friends and family of best security practices when managing their life on all
                    online platforms.
